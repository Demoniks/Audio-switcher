# Audio-switcher
Built using Python and Autohotkey. A fully automated code to detect Web browser (Chrome for now) audio in order to stop Apple Music audio. Once Web browser audio is stopped, runs an autohotkey script to switch to Apple Music and play music and switch back to last web browser played (Chrome for now).
