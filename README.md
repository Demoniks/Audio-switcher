# Audio-switcher
Built using Python and Autohotkey. A fully automated code to detect Web browser (Chrome for now) audio in order to stop Apple Music audio. Once Web browser audio is stopped, runs an autohotkey script to switch to Apple Music and play music and switch back to last web browser played (Chrome for now).


Future improvements:
Create an interactive menu.
Automated for any web browser.
Fix bugs.
Make the script be able to play the music on the last audio music app used, if Apple Music was used but Spotify running now, to return to Spotify instead of AM.
More smart features: if both music apps run simmultaneously, last music app running audio stop the other app.
Add Spotify API to make it more interactive and fun. With it's own menu to choose your own playlist, randomize playlist, choose your fav. music, start different podcast/playlist for certain days, hours and moods for each day of your own preference (modular to your own choices).
